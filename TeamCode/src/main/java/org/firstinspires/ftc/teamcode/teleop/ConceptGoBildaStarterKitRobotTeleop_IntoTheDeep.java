/*
 * This OpMode is an example driver-controlled (TeleOp) mode for the goBILDA 2024-2025 FTC
 * Into The Deep Starter Robot
 * The code is structured as a LinearOpMode
 *
 * This robot has a two-motor differential-steered (sometimes called tank or skid steer) drivetrain.
 * With a left and right drive motor.
 * The drive on this robot is controlled in an "Arcade" style, with the left stick Y axis
 * controlling the forward movement and the right stick X axis controlling rotation.
 * This allows easy transition to a standard "First Person" control of a
 * mecanum or omnidirectional chassis.
 *
 * The drive wheels are 96mm diameter traction (Rhino) or omni wheels.
 * They are driven by 2x 5203-2402-0019 312RPM Yellow Jacket Planetary Gearmotors.
 *
 * This robot's main scoring mechanism includes an arm powered by a motor, a "wrist" driven
 * by a servo, and an intake driven by a continuous rotation servo.
 *
 * The arm is powered by a 5203-2402-0051 (50.9:1 Yellow Jacket Planetary Gearmotor) with an
 * external 5:1 reduction. This creates a total ~254.47:1 reduction.
 * This OpMode uses the motor's encoder and the RunToPosition method to drive the arm to
 * specific setpoints. These are defined as a number of degrees of rotation away from the arm's
 * starting position.
 *
 * Make super sure that the arm is reset into the robot, and the wrist is folded in before
 * you run start the OpMode. The motor's encoder is "relative" and will move the number of degrees
 * you request it to based on the starting position. So if it starts too high, all the motor
 * setpoints will be wrong.
 *
 * The wrist is powered by a goBILDA Torque Servo (2000-0025-0002).
 *
 * The intake wheels are powered by a goBILDA Speed Servo (2000-0025-0003) in Continuous Rotation mode.
